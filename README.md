> The **Enriched Editor** plugin adds lots of additional options to the ClassicPress visual editor. This plugin is a fork of TinyMCE Advanced for WordPress and contains no Gutenberg code.

### Pre-Installation
If you already have _TinyMCE Advanced_ or _WYWIWYG Advanced_ installed, you will need to deactivate and delete before installing _Enriched Editor_. If you want to preserve your current editor settings, you can export them to a text file before deleting the current plugin. You can then import those settings back into Enriched Editor after you get it installed.

### Editor Options

  Enable the Enriched Editor for primary editing screens, including those for _posts_, _pages_, and _custom post types_.
* **Enable Editor for Secondary Areas**
  Enable the Enriched Editor for secondary editing areas, including those for _text widgets_ and other _textarea inputs_.
* **Enable Editor for Public Use**
  Enable the Enriched Editor for public use, such as in _user comments_ and other _textarea inputs_.
* **Advanced Menu**
  Enable the advanced menu (_File_, _Edit_, _Insert_, _View_, _Format_, _Table_, and _Tools_) for the first row.
* **Enhanced Lists**

* **Right-Click**
